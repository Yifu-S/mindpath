## üîí Privacy & Security

### **How does MindPath protect my privacy?**

MindPath uses military-grade encryption to ensure your data is completely private:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted with AES-256 before leaving your device
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: We literally cannot decrypt your data - only you can access it
- **Anonymous Authentication**: No real names, email addresses, or student IDs required
- **Local-First Storage**: Sensitive data is stored primarily on your device
- **Complete Data Ownership**: You can export or permanently delete your data anytime

### **Can my university, parents, or roommates find out I'm using MindPath?**

**No.** MindPath is designed to be completely private:

- No institutional integration with universities
- No data sharing with third parties
- No tracking of real identities
- No connection to academic records
- No way for others to discover your usage

### **What happens to my data if I delete my account?**

When you delete your account, all your data is permanently erased from our servers. You can also:

- Export your data before deletion
- Use the emergency data wipe feature for immediate deletion
- Choose to keep data local-only (never synced to servers)

## ü§ñ AI & Technology

### **How does the AI work?**

MindPath uses OpenAI's advanced language models to provide:

- **Personalized Journal Responses**: AI analyzes your entries and provides supportive, relevant feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends in your mood and emotional patterns
- **Coping Strategies**: Suggests evidence-based techniques based on your specific situation
- **Academic Context Awareness**: Understands student life challenges and academic calendars

### **Is the AI advice reliable?**

The AI provides supportive guidance and coping strategies, but it's not a replacement for professional mental health care. We recommend:

- Using MindPath for daily wellness and stress management
- Seeking professional help for severe mental health concerns
- Consulting campus counseling for clinical support
- Using crisis resources for emergencies

### **What if the AI gives inappropriate advice?**

We've carefully designed the AI to provide supportive, evidence-based responses. However, if you encounter any concerning content:

- Report it immediately through the feedback system
- The AI is regularly monitored and updated
- Human oversight ensures quality and safety
- Crisis detection automatically suggests professional resources
